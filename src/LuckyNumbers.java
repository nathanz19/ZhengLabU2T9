           For this lucky number game, there are 5 balls randomly drawn,
           each between 1 and 65, and one "super ball" between 1 and 30.

           In this game, the same number CAN appear more than once.

           The returned String should have the 6 numbers listed (they do not
           need to be in ascending order): 5 "lucky numbers" between 1 and 65,
           and the last one, the "super ball," between 1 and 30.
           See samples below.

           This method should call your randomIntegerBetween method above multiple times --
            don't rewrite the same code over and over to generate multiple random numbers,
            use your method!
